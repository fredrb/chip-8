# Chip-8 Emulator

The hello world of Emulator development.

```
cargo run <path to ROM>
```

This project was developed with the purpose of learning. It is not a reference to how one should implement a Chip-8 Emulator. A good place to start would be [Cowgod's Chip-8 Reference](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM) and the [Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8).
